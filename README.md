# FlightGeneratorSimulator

## Description
The Flight Generator is a Python-based tool that creates different flight scenarios using QGIS. This application is designed to simulate various flight scenarios, including live scenarios and pre-defined ones. Please note that this tool requires QGIS to be installed, and you'll need to customize the paths in the `config_parameters.py` file to match your PC settings.

### Features
- **online_generator.py:** This script generates live flight scenarios, providing dynamic and real-time modification of flights. This script sends real time flight information that were generated by the user to the required network. It did have an option to record the scenarios generated to an excel file, unfortunately, it is not included in this version.

- **qgis_app.py:** This script allows you to create flight scenarios that are pre-defined or known in advance. The aim of this script was to create an excel file to record flight paths.

## Prerequisites
Before running the Flight Generator, make sure you have the following software and configurations in place:

- **QGIS:** The Flight Generator relies on QGIS for geospatial data processing and visualization. Ensure that QGIS is properly installed on your system.

- **Configurations:** Open the `config_parameters.py` file and customize the paths and settings according to your system requirements. This file contains essential parameters that the Flight Generator relies on for file locations and other configurations.

## Usage
1. Open QGIS.

2. Configure the `config_parameters.py` file with the correct paths and settings specific to your system.

3. Run the desired script in QGIS python console*:
   - To generate live scenarios, run `online_generator.py`.
   - To create pre-defined scenarios, run `qgis_app.py`.

* In order to run it in your python IDE, you have to set up a QGIS environment in your python IDE.
  
4. Follow the on-screen prompts and inputs to set up your flight scenarios.

5. Analyze and visualize the flight scenarios using QGIS or any other preferred tools.
